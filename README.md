# Sudoku Solver
- Written in Java
- Fun application of backtracking algo
- Supports custom (9x9) board in "Board.txt" (use "custom" as arg to invoke)
- Otherwise, it automatically generates a board, then solves it
- Might implement Knuth's Algorithm X to make it faster for larger boards (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) and (https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~aassaf9/python/algorithm_x.html)

## Usage
- Requires JVM to run 'Sudoku.class' (java bytecode)
### For Compilation:
1. In terminal run
- Linux: 'chmod +x run.sh' then './run.sh'
- Windows: 'run'
